1: implement registers 
  - Get way to print FP and do the operations
  - use big int to do the printing.
  -- finish big int division and subtraction
  - use contribution from every position look to the oeis thing
  
2: figure out the cycle timing for the instructions, and the pipeline stuff. Maybe we assume perfect? I'm not sure.
3: Implement the instructions
4: Implement the memory
5: Implement the IO
